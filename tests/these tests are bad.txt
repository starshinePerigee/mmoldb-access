These tests expect a live MMOLDB database and a valid configuration!
That's not the best practice (ideally you'd instantiate one as a fixture, or use mocks)
but be glad you're getting tests at all!

btw tdd is awesome and you should do it

but I bet half of you fucks don't even use a real debugger so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
